# 👋 Hi, I'm Brian Mwangi

I’m a developer passionate about solving real-world problems through machine learning, language technology, and developer tools. My work revolves around building solutions that empower underrepresented communities — especially in Africa — through open-source projects, AI, and software infrastructure.
